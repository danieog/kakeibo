A financial goal tracker that not only allows users to keep track of their finances properly, but also ranks users based on various factors. Includes a “purchase or purchase not” bot that asks a series of questions and based on the answers, advises the person to make the purchase or not. If the user decides to go ahead with the purchase, it gives a projected budget to better inform the user of the outcome of the decision and whether or not it will "break" the budget. It links to one or multipe banking institutions and offers separate or merged budget plans, where each institution can be treated independently or can be "merged" to plan a collective budget for.
